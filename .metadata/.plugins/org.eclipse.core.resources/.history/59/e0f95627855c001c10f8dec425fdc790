/**
 * Description: This program acts as a digital media shelf for a user, it allows
 * them to manage all of the media items in their collection. The user can enter
 * 2 main types of media, movies, and songs. They can choose to add new songs,
 * and remove any songs which they have added, and do not want anymore. The user
 * can then output all of their songs and movies, using toString methods, in a
 * friendly format. I will also be personally implementing functionality to
 * allow the user to edit the songs and movies which they have already entered,
 * as-well as checking that they have entered all the correct info. Finally,
 * their media will all be outputted to a text file, for easier accessibility at
 * a later time.
